Issues with the code

- [ ] Deal with multi-particle
    - [x] Add connections
    - [ ] Add simplification of paths

- [ ] Automatize higher order calculations
    - [x] Starting by canonical diagrams of order 1.
    - [ ] Add canonical diagrams of higher order.

- [ ] Avoid line superpositions 
    - [x] Make it possible
    - [ ] Detect superpositions 
        * The superpositions happen when 3 points are alinged, but not all cases are problematic:
            * 2 lines are connected with an additional point in between
            * 3 point alingned (say 1, 2, 3) with a path connected as (1, 3, 2). This way a path is invisible.
    - [ ] Avoid superpositions when needed
