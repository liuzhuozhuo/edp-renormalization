Issues with the code

- [x] Deal with multi-particle
    - [x] Add connections
    - [x] Add simplification of paths

- [x] Automatize higher order calculations
    - [x] Starting by canonical diagrams of order 1.
    - [x] Add canonical diagrams of higher order.

- [x] Avoid line superpositions 
    - [x] Make it possible
    - [x] Detect superpositions 
        * The superpositions happen when 3 points are alinged, but not all cases are problematic:
            * 2 lines are connected with an additional point in between
            * 3 point alingned (say 1, 2, 3) with a path connected as (1, 3, 2). This way a path is invisible.
    - [x] Avoid superpositions when needed

- How the counterterms are implemented
- Fix the counting when canonical diagrams are present.
